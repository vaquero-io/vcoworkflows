`vcoworkflows` provides a Ruby API for finding and executing vCenter
Orchestrator workflows. You can search for a workflow either by name or
by GUID, populate the resulting `VcoWorkflows::Workflow` object's
input parameters with the required values, and then request that the
the configured workflow be executed by vCenter Orchestrator.

Under the hood, communcations with vCenter Orchestrator is done via its
REST API, and all the REST heavy-lifting here is done by the fine and reliable
[`rest-client`](https://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client) gem. HTTP Basic
authentication is used with vCenter Orchestrator, and the username and
password can either be passed as command-line arguments or set as environment
variables (`$VCO_USER` and `$VCO_PASSWD`).

## Requirements

- [rest-client](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client) is used for all the
communications with vCenter Orchestrator.
- [thor](http://whatisthor.com) is used for the command-line utilities.

The only external dependency is vCenter Orchestrator.

## Installation

`vcoworkflows` is distributed as a ruby gem.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vcoworkflows'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install vcoworkflows

## Usage

Quick example:

```ruby
require 'vcoworkflows'
workflow = VcoWorkflows::Workflow.new(
    'Request Component',
    url: 'https://vco.example.com:8281/',
    username: 'jdoe',
    password: 's3cr3t'
)

```

All the necessary interactions with a Workflow in vCenter Orchestrator are
available via the [`VcoWorkflows::Workflow`](lib/vcoworkflows/Workflow.rb)
class.

### Selecting a Workflow

It is possible to select a Workflow by GUID (as divined by the vCenter
Orchestrator client) or by specifying the Workflow's name. If specifying by
name, however, an exception will be raised if either no workflows are found,
or multiple workflows are found. Therefor, GUID is likely "safer". In either
case, however, the workflow name must be given, as in the example above.

Selecting a workflow by GUID is done by adding the `id:` parameter when
creating a new `Workflow` object:

```ruby
workflow = VcoWorkflows::Workflow.new(
    'Request Component',
    id: '6e04a460-4a45-4e16-9603-db2922c24462',
    url: 'https://vco.example.com:8281/',
    username: 'jdoe',
    password: 's3cr3t'
)
```

### Executing a workflow

To execute a workflow, set any input parameters to appropriate values (if
required), then send call `execute`. This will return an execution ID from
vCenter Orchestrator, which identifies the run you have requested. The
execution ID is also preserved in the `Workflow` object for simplicity.

Setting parameters individually:

```ruby
workflow.parameter('name', 'a string value')
worfklow.parameter('version', 2)
workflow.parameter('words', %w(fe fi fo fum))
```

Setting parameters via a hash:

```ruby
workflow.parameters = { 'name'    => 'a string value',
                        'version' => '2',
                        'words'   => %w(fe fi fo fum) }
```

Then execute:

```ruby
workflow.execute
```

### Checking an execution status

You can then get a Workflow Token from the Workflow, which will contain
state and result information for the execution.

```ruby
wf_token = workflow.token(workflow.execute)
```

The `WorkflowToken` can be used to determine the current state and disposition
of a Workflow execution. This can be used to periodically check up on the
execution, if you want to follow its status:

```ruby
finished = false
until finished
  sleep 5
  # Fetch a new workflow token to check the status of the workflow execution
  wftoken = workflow.token
  # If the execution is no longer alive, exit the loop and report the results.
  unless wftoken.alive?
    finished = true
    wftoken.output_parameters.each { |k, v| puts " #{k}: #{v}" }
  end
end
```

### Fetching the execution log

For any workflow execution, you can fetch the log:

```ruby
workflow.execute
# ... some time later
log = workflow.log
puts log
```

If you have the execution ID from a previous execution:

```ruby
log = workflow.log(execution_id)
puts log
```

### Querying a Workflow from the command line

The `vcoworkflows` command line allows you to query a vCO server for a
workflow, as well as executions and details on a specific execution.

```
$ vcoworkflows query "Request Component" \
    --server=https://vco.example.com:8281/

## Current limitations

### General vCO REST API functionality

This gem is very specifically targeted at operation of workflows within vCO.
As such, anything that was not necessary or required to be able to operate
workflows has not yet been included.

### Cancellation / Termination of running workflows

There is currently no facility to cancel a running workflow. This will be
added at some point in the future.

### Parameter Types

Currently, there is no included support for complex parameter types (i.e.,
anything other than Strings, Numerics, or Arrays of same). This is not to say
they cannot be used, but you will need to marshall vCO object parameters into an
appropriately-constructed `Hash` to pass as the parameter value, such that when
the values are converted to JSON for the actual REST call, they are properly
constructed for vCO.
